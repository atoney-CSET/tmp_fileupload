Automatic organization of scholarly literature
is a challenging but essential task. In particular, assigning key concepts to scientific publications allows researchers, policymakers, and
the general public to search for and discover
relevant research. But any meaningful organization of scientific publications must evolve with
new research, requiring up-to-date and scalable
text classification models. Additionally, scientific research publications benefit from multilabel classification, particularly with more finegrained sub-domains. Prior work has focused
on classifying scientific publications from one
research area (e.g., computer science), referencing static concept descriptions, and implementing English-only classification models. We
propose a multi-label classification model that
can be implemented in non-English languages,
across all scientific literature, with dynamic
concepts.
